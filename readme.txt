The YITH WooCommerce Frequently Bought Together plugin lets you add product suggestions with a simple summary in each product page.

== Description ==
YITH Frequently Bought Together for WooCommerce allows you to display an upsell section on the product page, suggest related items (usually bought together) and increase your store conversions.  

It's an effective strategy for encouraging your customers to add more items to their cart and increase the value of their order. Amazon A/B testing has shown that displaying related and complementary products and offering a discount for purchasing multiple products in the same order can increase conversions by 10-15%

= How does it work? =

Installing and configuring the products you want to suggest for combined purchase is all you need to start building a targeted upsell strategy in your store.
Full documentation is available [here](https://docs.yithemes.com/yith-woocommerce-frequently-bought-together/).
